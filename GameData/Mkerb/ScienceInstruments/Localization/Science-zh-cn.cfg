		#MKERB-Time_KerbinInSpaceHigh  = As you get farther away from Kerbin, time passes every so slightly faster than normal. Future instrumentation will be built to account for this.
		#MKERB-Time_MunInSpace  = As you approach the mass of the Mun, time is beginning to dilate again.
		#MKERB-Time_MunSrfLanded  = Time dilation definitely correlates with gravitational pull and velocity.
		#MKERB-Time_MunFlyingLow  = Time is slowly getting faster again as gravity overtakes orbital velocity.
		#MKERB-Time_MunFlyingHigh  = The clock spins wildly out of control! Oh, no, wait, you just have it wired incorrectly.
		#MKERB-Time_MinmusInSpace  = You could've sworn that the clock just whispered that it loves you.
		#MKERB-Time_MinmusSrfLanded  = There's no effect on the passage of time. Probably because Minmus has a very small mass.
